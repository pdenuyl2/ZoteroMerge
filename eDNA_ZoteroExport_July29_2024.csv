Here, we investigate the metabarcoding performance of universal degenerate cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) primers in detecting species from this challenging phylum in a cryptobenthic community. Twenty-two modified Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) were deployed for 2 years in mesocosms receiving unfiltered seawater from an adjacent reef slope. Upon recovery, each unit was inspected by a marine sponge taxonomist who used a combination of taxonomy, imagery, and DNA barcoding (28S rRNA and COI) to identify sponges and generate a validated taxonomic richness value for each ARMS unit. A total of 69 unique sponge barcoded morphologies (BMs) were identified from the classes Calcarea, Demospongiae, and Homoscleromorpha. Metabarcoding identified 41 unique sponge molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) from Demospongiae and Homoscleromorpha but the primers failed to amplify any species from the class Calcarea which comprised 22% of the BMs. Sponge richness did not differ between BMs and MOTUs assigned to the classes Demospongiae and Homoscleromorpha. However, assignments at the order and family level in Demospongiae underscore known limitations in sponge taxonomic resolution using the COI gene. The prevalence of false positives within the order Suberitida and the pervasiveness of false negatives within the order Haplosclerida highlighted both technical and biological constraints in the metabarcoding method. Overall, these results confirm the need for discretion in sponge MOTU assignments using universal degenerate barcoding primers that target a short fragment of the COI gene. However, they also demonstrate that COI metabarcoding is capable of capturing sponge richness from a complex natural community.","2022-01-01","2024-07-26 19:16:53","2024-07-26 19:16:53","2024-07-26","239-253","","1","4","","Environmental DNA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","28S; COI; community metabarcoding; coral reefs; cryptobenthic; DNA barcoding; mesocosm; Porifera","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In marine environments, physical characteristics?such as tides and currents?can influence the distribution of eDNA. In this study, we make use of hatchery net pens containing >46?million juvenile chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) in nearshore Southeast Alaska to test for dispersion of eDNA and the effects of tide. Initially, we collected and filtered surface water every 80?m along a 2?km transect to test eDNA attenuation over surface distance during incoming and outgoing tides on a single day. The following year, we sampled at three depths (0?m, 5?m, and 10?m) every 500?m along the same transect as well as along a perpendicular transect, to understand dispersion by depth and in additional directions. Chum salmon eDNA was quantified using species-specific qPCR. We found that surface samples showed a consistent signal of decreasing chum salmon eDNA across the 2?km transect (R2?=?0.665), with the majority of eDNA detections within 1.5?km of the net pens. Tide had a significant effect, resulting in higher concentrations of chum DNA throughout the transect during incoming tide and a steeper decline in eDNA over distance during outgoing tide (R2?=?0.759). Depth affected chum salmon DNA concentration, with the majority of eDNA at the surface and a decreasing amount of DNA with increasing depth. This study addresses one of the critical knowledge gaps in applying eDNA to marine fisheries management by providing empirical evidence of eDNA dispersion and demonstrating that most eDNA detections are likely from nearby individuals that are either currently or recently present. Yet even at close proximity, eDNA signal strength fluctuates and depends on the physical environmental variables during a given sampling event.","2024-03-01","2024-07-26 19:16:53","2024-07-26 19:16:53","2024-07-26","e533","","2","6","","Environmental DNA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","qPCR; transport; coastal; environmental DNA; marine; salmon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Workshop was attended by 150 people in-person and an additional 200 more online. Workshop attendees represented a broad cross-section of disciplines and backgrounds, including research scientists, state, and federal agencies, and those in the environmental management sector. This diverse collection of attendees assembled with the goal of achieving cross-sector collaboration and working together to identify the necessary next steps to move eDNA methods into the management application mainstream. The Workshop structure included a Training Day oriented towards environmental managers and those new to eDNA science, to facilitate a common ground for discussions on subsequent days. The Plenary Day focused on case studies about eDNA applications and culminated with a roundtable panel discussion with local, state, and federal agency representatives on eDNA method readiness and the road to method adoption. Among the key takeaways from the Workshop was bridging the communication gap between researchers and managers because scientists often focus on technical details and the unknowns, giving the impression that eDNA science is not yet mature, whereas managers want to hear consensus statements about readiness and a roadmap for method adoption, including standard operating procedures, lab accreditation, and unified sequence libraries. This outcome was a clear directive for many scientists in attendance that it is time to stop letting perfect be the enemy of good and to focus future efforts on method harmonization and a national strategy towards method adoption. The Workshop concluded with a working session of invited participants to identify key priorities and needs to achieve the goals highlighted in the Workshop discussions.","2024-01-01","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26","e379","","1","6","","Environmental DNA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","qPCR; environmental DNA; barcoding; bioinformatics; conservation management; ddPCR; digital droplet PCR; metabarcoding; practical implementation; quantitative PCR; sequence libraries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The macroalgae Caulerpa prolifera is considered an invasive species outside its native range, colonizing large patches of seafloor, reducing native species, and altering ecosystem functioning. Here, we developed a droplet digital PCR assay for detection of C. prolifera from environmental DNA seawater samples using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. While the assay itself was confirmed to be highly efficient, we discovered concentrations of C. prolifera eDNA were present below detectable levels in the water column surrounding an outbreak. To understand why, we conducted tank-based experiments for two California invasive algae species, Caulerpa prolifera and Sargassum horneri. The steady-state eDNA concentration (eDNA copies/ gram of biomass detected) of C. prolifera was found to be two orders of magnitude lower than S. horneri. A meta-analysis of steady-state concentrations reported in the literature showed a remarkable range from ~104?1011 (copies/g), revealing C. prolifera to have the lowest recorded steady-state concentrations of eDNA of any known species. We attribute C. prolifera's low steady-state eDNA concentration to its unique biology as a unicellular macroscopic algae which reduces the possible modes of eDNA release compared to similarly sized multicellular organisms. Critically our results demonstrate the potential limits of eDNA approaches, the influence of shedding rates in the reliability of species detections, and the vital importance of benchmarking and validating eDNA assays in both field and laboratory settings.","2024-01-01","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26","e496","","1","6","","Environmental DNA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","environmental DNA; benchmarking; Caulerpa; introduced species; Sargassum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, fish-specific eDNA resources are currently not well-developed, and many fish species are not yet sequenced in reference databases. We developed Mitohelper, a Python-based command line tool to annotate and align fish mitochondrial sequences available in the existing MitoFish database. Mitohelper improves MitoFish annotations by adding gene names and additional taxonomic classifications. Using these improved reference datasets, Mitohelper's getrecord function searches MitoFish for available mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase, 12S rRNA, and others) gene sequences against a user-provided list of fish taxonomic names. Mitohelper's getalignment function aligns (often partial) mitochondrial gene sequences to a user-specified full-length reference sequence for the assessment and visualization of overlapping sequencing regions. To facilitate the development of taxonomic classifiers, we combined Mitohelper's 12S rRNA dataset with SILVA?s 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA datasets in a QIIME 2-compatible format. By providing valuable information on taxonomic and gene region coverage of currently available fish mitochondrial data, Mitohelper's functions promote informed experimental design that can guide sequencing and analysis strategies. In summary, Mitohelper improves the breadth and functionality of eDNA data resources, as well as the accuracy of taxonomic classification.

Here we test whether multi-species PCR, that is, metabarcoding, with an internal standard can quantify eDNA of marine bony fish. Replicate amplifications with Riaz 12?S gene primers were spiked with known amounts of a non-fish vertebrate DNA standard, indexed separately, and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Fish eDNA copies were calculated by comparing fish and standard reads. Relative reads were directly proportional to relative DNA copies, with average and maximum variance between replicates of about 1.3- and 2-fold, respectively. There was an apparent minimum threshold for consistent amplification of about 10 eDNA copies per PCR reaction. The internal DNA standard corrected for suppression of fish read counts due to amplification of non-fish DNA. To assess potential PCR bias among species, we compared reads obtained with Riaz 12?S primers to those with modified MiFish primers, which target a different 12?S gene segment. Our results provide evidence that Riaz 12?S gene metabarcoding with an internal DNA standard quantifies marine bony fish eDNA over a range of about 10?5000 copies per reaction, without indication of significant PCR bias among teleost species. In mid-Atlantic coastal samples, eDNA rarity was the main limitation to reproducible detection and quantification, and this was partly overcome by increasing the amount of a DNA sample amplified. Our findings support incorporating a DNA standard in 12?S metabarcoding to help quantify eDNA abundance for marine bony fish species.","2024-01-01","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26","e376","","1","6","","Environmental DNA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","eDNA; environmental DNA; metabarcoding; bottom trawl survey; coastal ecosystem; marine fish; quantitative metabarcoding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, such community analyses typically are limited by time and effort of sampling, sorting, and identifications, as well as morphological character uncertainty for some taxa, especially at early life stages. Our objective was to evaluate a suite of targeted metabarcode high-throughput sequencing assays to characterize the macroinvertebrate communities (specifically targeting Annelida, Bryozoa, Crustacea, Insecta, and Mollusca) from environmental (e)DNA water samples along 160 km of the Maumee River, OH (a major Lake Erie, Laurentian Great Lakes tributary). Multiple alpha (richness, Shannon Index, and Simpson's Index) and beta (Bray?Curtis and S?rensen dissimilarities) diversity metrics from the metabarcode assays were compared with an Invertebrate Community Index (ICI) metric calculated from traditional morphological sampling surveys conducted by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. The 15 Maumee River sites varied in their ICI scores (ranging from 4 to 46), with seven sites rated as ?poor? or ?very poor? and eight scoring ?fair? or ?good.? Metabarcoding assays yielded greater gamma richness, delineating 181 Operational Taxonomic Units versus 172 taxa from morphology (the latter often limited to family or genus-level identifications). Both datasets supported similar river-wide trends, with comparable gamma, alpha, and beta diversity patterns and community compositions across habitat types and habitat quality scores. Metabarcode assays revealed similar detection of important bioindicator Insecta, but missed most Trichoptera (caddisflies). eDNA identified eight aquatic invasive species on the GLANSIS (Great Lakes Aquatic Nonindigenous Species Information System) list, including three missed by the morphological surveys (Branchiura sowerbyi, Potamothrix bedoti, and Skistodiaptomus pallidus; with Lophopodella carteri, Faxonius rusticus, Corbicula fluminea, Dreissena polymorpha, and Valvata piscinalis in both datasets).

The key to making accurate taxonomic assignments is curated, comprehensive reference barcode databases. However, the generation and curation of such databases has remained challenging given the large and continuously growing volumes of both DNA sequence data and novel reference barcode targets. Monitoring and research applications require a greater diversity of specialized gene regions and targeted taxa than are currently curated by professional staff. Thus, there is a growing need for an easy-to-implement computational tool that can generate comprehensive metabarcoding reference libraries for any bespoke locus. We address this need by reimagining CRUX from the Anacapa Toolkit and present the rCRUX package in R which, like its predecessor, relies on sequence homology and PCR primer compatibility instead of keyword searches to avoid limitations of user-defined metadata. The typical workflow involves searching for plausible seed amplicons (get_seeds_local() or get_seeds_remote()) by simulating in silico PCR to acquire a set of sequences analogous to PCR products containing a user-defined set of primer sequences. Next, these seeds are used to iteratively blast search seed sequences against a local copy of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)-formatted nt database using a taxonomic rank-based stratified random sampling approach (blast_seeds()). This results in a comprehensive set of sequence matches. This database is dereplicated and cleaned (derep_and_clean_db()) by identifying identical reference sequences and collapsing the taxonomic path to the lowest taxonomic agreement across all matching reads. This results in a curated, comprehensive database of primer-specific reference barcode sequences from NCBI. Databases can then be compared (compare_db()) to determine read and taxonomic overlap. We demonstrate that rCRUX provides more comprehensive reference databases for the MiFish Universal Teleost 12S, Taberlet trnl, fungal ITS, and Leray CO1 loci than CRABS, MetaCurator, RESCRIPt, and ecoPCR reference databases. We then further demonstrate the utility of rCRUX by generating 24 reference databases for 20 metabarcoding loci, many of which lack dedicated reference database curation efforts. The rCRUX package provides a simple-to-use tool for the generation of curated, comprehensive reference databases for user-defined loci, facilitating accurate and effective taxonomic classification of metabarcoding and DNA sequence efforts broadly.","2024-01-01","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26","e489","","1","6","","Environmental DNA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sterivex filters have become popular for collecting aquatic eDNA, allowing for on-site filtration and reduced contamination. Yet, extracting eDNA from an enclosed filter remains laborious. Recent methods have improved extraction of microbial DNA from Sterivex by adding lysis buffer and beads directly to the filter; however, it remains unclear how bead size affects eDNA recovery across multiple trophic levels. Further, the method has not been scaled up for 96-well magnetic bead extraction kits and robotic manipulation. We collected surface water from Bear Cut (Biscayne Bay, Florida) and performed enclosed Sterivex DNA extractions with different bead size combinations (0.1, 0.5, 0.1 + 0.5 mm, and no beads) and two magnetic kits (Zymo and NucleoMag). We employed 16S and 12S rRNA gene metabarcoding to assess extraction effects on microbes (bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes) and bony fishes. We polled local experts to verify fish eDNA, revealing several non-native taxa originating from a nearby aquarium. DNA yield, microbial richness, and diversity were not influenced by beads. Bacterial relative abundance (family to ASV) was conserved across bead treatments, while several hard-to-lyse eukaryotes (diatoms and chlorophytes) were less abundant (or absent) when extracted without beads. Higher fish richness was detected with larger beads; however, relative abundance and composition were not associated with beads, likely reflecting heterogeneity or low concentrations of fish compared to microbial eDNA. We recommend using larger or differently sized beads for Sterivex extractions to detect a range of marine life, with increased water volume (>2 L per filter) or replication as necessary to enhance fish eDNA capture.","2022-03-01","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26","291-303","","2","4","","Environmental DNA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","beads; bony fishes; eDNA extraction; marine life; microbes; Sterivex","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Few methods are used to survey the taxonomically rich cryptobiome, which is made up of inhabitants from within microhabitats. One way that cryptic marine biodiversity can be non-invasively surveyed is by analyzing environmental DNA (eDNA) present in seawater. Using coral reefs as a model system, here we compare estimates of cryptic diversity among community biomass and eDNA metabarcoding sampling methods with a broad eukaryotic marker (COI). First, contributions to eDNA were investigated across cryptobiomes through a comparison of community metabarcoded biomass from standardized autonomous reef monitoring structures (ARMS) to eDNA acquired from seawater in which individual ARMS were soaked. Second, we compared these results to those from eDNA samples taken from within reef crevices and the ambient water column. Metabarcoding of community biomass from ARMS and eDNA from the two types of water samples revealed significantly different communities of cryptic coral reef habitat with little overlap between methods. Taxa that were unique to metabarcoding of ARMS biomass were predominantly from chitinous and calcifying groups (polychaetes, palaemonid shrimp, mollusks, brittle stars, and red algae), which suggests that these taxa are underrepresented in eDNA surveys. Other than the corals themselves, sponges and red algae were significant drivers of reef crevice community differences, while ambient seawater samples detected mostly planktonic organisms and reef fishes. Our data indicate that both eDNA and ARMS provide incomplete accounting of cryptic diversity. Direct sampling of biomass is best suited for building taxonomies and improving databases, whereas eDNA methods offer rapid insights into the composition of cryptobiomes. Because each method likely captures different taxa, multiple targeted assays can be used to provide the greatest estimates of metazoan and macroalgal richness.","2022-01-01","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26","93-107","","1","4","","Environmental DNA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","coral reefs; biodiversity; cytochrome c oxidase I; eDNA methods; marine metazoans","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using multiple primer sets that amplify different genes can mitigate biases in amplification efficiency, sequence resolution, and reference data availability, but few empirical studies have evaluated markers for complementary performance. Here, we assess the individual and joint performance of 22 markers for detecting species in a DNA pool of 98 species of marine and freshwater bony fishes from geographically and phylogenetically diverse origins. We find that a portfolio of four markers targeting 12S, 16S, and two regions of COI identifies 100% of reference taxa to family and nearly 60% to species. We then use these four markers to evaluate metabarcoding of heterogeneous tissue mixtures, using experimental fishmeal to test: (1) the tissue input threshold to ensure detection; (2) how read depth scales with tissue abundance; and (3) the effect of non-target material in the mixture on recovery of target taxa. We consistently detect taxa that makeup >1% of fishmeal mixtures and can detect taxa at the lowest input level of 0.01%, but rare taxa (<1%) were detected inconsistently across markers and replicates. Read counts showed only a weak correlation with tissue input, suggesting they are not a reliable quantitative proxy for relative abundance. Despite the limitations arising from primer specificity and reference data availability, our results demonstrate that a modest portfolio of markers can perform well in detecting and identifying aquatic species in complex mixtures despite heterogeneity in tissue representation, phylogenetic affinities, and from a broad geographic range.","2023-11-01","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26","1589-1607","","6","5","","Environmental DNA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we leverage eDNA metabarcoding to characterize nearshore fish communities near Juneau, Alaska, USA, a high-latitude environment with large tidal swings, strong currents, and significant freshwater input. We investigated whether species richness and community composition differed across three habitat types (sand beaches, eelgrass beds, and rocky shorelines) and between high and low tides. Additionally, we tested whether replication of field samples and PCR reactions influenced either species richness or composition. We amplified a 12S mitochondrial locus in our samples and identified 167 fish amplicon sequence variants, which were grouped into 24 unique taxa based on sequence similarity, with approximately half of these taxa resolved to single species. Species richness and composition inferred from eDNA differed substantially among habitats, with rock habitats containing fewer taxa and fewer overall detections than sand and eelgrass habitats. The effect of tide was not significant on its own, but a significant habitat-tide interaction was documented, with the most pronounced differences in taxa between tides found in sand habitats. Power analyses indicated that additional field sampling is useful to detect small changes in species richness such as those due to tide. PCR replicates typically identified few additional taxa. Our results provide important information that can be used to guide future studies, most notably, that the influence of tide on eDNA results appears to be minimal and potentially isolated to certain habitats. This suggests that replication across tides may not be vital for future eDNA studies and that additional replication across space?particularly across heterogeneous environments?likely is a better allocation of sampling effort.","2022-07-01","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26","868-880","","4","4","","Environmental DNA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","marine fish; Alaska; eDNA metabarcoding; habitat; nearshore; tide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has resulted in changes in the aquatic and terrestrial vegetation, but historical records on the composition of the past vegetation on centennial scale are scarce. In this study, we examined changes in the terrestrial and aquatic plant communities in and around Lower Lake Constance using metabarcoding of sedimentary DNA (sedDNA) of three cores from different sub-basins covering the past, up to 300 years. We successfully identified an average of c. 3000 sequence variants (molecular operational taxonomic units - MOTUs) and obtained a taxonomically annotated dataset of 127 species, 104 genera, and 72 families. We could detect major changes in the terrestrial and aquatic vegetation of the Lower Lake Constance region by examining the cores. For example, alpha diversity decreased in the last c. 100 years, and this decrease was more pronounced in the terrestrial than in the aquatic plant community. Unlike the terrestrial plant community, the current aquatic plant-community composition partially resembles the community from before the 20th-century eutrophication phase of the lake. In addition to changes that can be attributed to anthropogenic impacts, we also captured the effect of DNA sedimentation on the terrestrial DNA diversity representation in sediments during periods of extensive flooding and potentially as a consequence of extremely cold winters. With sedDNA from Lower Lake Constance, we provide a new local dataset to investigate and extend the historical changes of different shoreline habitats and to identify characteristic and invasive plant species. Such highly resolved datasets spanning the past centuries can provide detailed information on human environmental history in densely populated regions that have undergone severe changes in the recent past.","2022-07-01","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26","830-845","","4","4","","Environmental DNA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","metabarcoding; anthropogenic change; lake sediments; land-use change; plant communities; sedimentary DNA; trnL primer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we developed and tested a new quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to detect Atlantic sturgeon environmental DNA (eDNA) in water samples with the goal of providing an alternative method to monitor presence and relative abundance. We also examined Atlantic sturgeon eDNA shedding rates in laboratory experiments. A qPCR-probe assay targeting Cytochrome B was developed and showed no amplification of other related and co-occurring fishes. Pond trials at a density of ~0.2 g/L sturgeon produced relatively strong eDNA detections (~1,000?25,000 copies/L) in all seven water samples assayed. Water samples taken from two river systems in the Chesapeake Bay produced zero eDNA detections in the summer, while fall sampling during sturgeon spawning produced positive eDNA detections in 26% of samples, though at much lower concentrations (400?1,800 copies/L) compared with the pond (mesocosm) detections. Acoustic detections of sturgeon near river sampling sites were positively associated with eDNA detections. However, the eDNA assay failed to detect the presence of sturgeon in some samples when abundances were very low or when fish were in deep water. Finally, Atlantic sturgeon eDNA shedding rates were estimated to be on the order of estimates for other fish species, which suggests that relatively weak detections in the field are not necessarily driven by low rates of eDNA shedding. Overall, eDNA analysis represents a promising new monitoring tool for Atlantic sturgeon. Applying these methods in other rivers along the US east coast is an important next step in documenting Atlantic sturgeon distribution for management and conservation purposes.","2021-07-01","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26","800-814","","4","3","","Environmental DNA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","conservation; decay; fish; spawning; telemetry; tidal river","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although much progress has been made regarding laboratory and fieldwork protocols, the issue of sampling efficiency requires further investigation, particularly in three-dimensional marine systems. This study focuses on fish community composition in marine ecosystems and aims to analyze the efficiency of sampling design given the sampling effort for distinguishing between different communities. We sampled three fjords in Northern Norway, taking samples along fjord transects and at three different depths, and amplified a fragment of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene of bony fishes using the MiFish primers. We evaluated the effect of (i) the number of sampling stations, (ii) samples' spatial distribution, and (iii) the data treatment approach (presence/absence versus semiquantitative) for maximizing the efficiency of eDNA metabarcoding sampling when inferring differences of fish community compositions between fjords. We found that the manner of data treatment strongly affected the minimum number of sampling stations required to detect differences among communities; because the semiquantitative approach retained some information about abundance of the underlying reads, it was the most efficient. Furthermore, we found little-to-no difference of fish communities in samples from intermediate depths when comparing vertical fish communities. Lastly, we found that the differences between fish communities at the surface were the highest across the horizontal distance and overall, samples ~30?km apart showed the highest variation in the horizontal distribution. Boosting sampling efficiency (reducing sampling effort without compromising ecological inferences) can significantly contribute to enhanced biodiversity management and efficient biomonitoring plans.","2024-01-01","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26","e409","","1","6","","Environmental DNA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","eDNA; metabarcoding; fish; heterogeneity; sampling design; spatial distribution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we examine the efficacy of a dual-assay eDNA metabarcoding approach for sessile benthic bioassessments in the turbid waters of the Lalang-garram marine parks, Kimberley, north-western Australia. We ask three principal questions: (1) ?Is the eDNA released by sessile benthic taxa (i.e., hard and soft corals, sponges and tunicates) locally detectable??, (2) ?What level of taxonomic resolution is afforded by eDNA metabarcoding using the ITS2 region??, and (3) ?How well does eDNA metabarcoding compare to conventional benthic survey techniques??. We report that a dual-assay eDNA metabarcoding approach can detect approximately 70% of the local benthic taxa (i.e., at a species, genus level). It is, however, not as effective at the individual/population level, detecting only approximately 40% of unique amplicon sequence variant (ASV) signals released by an array of individual benthic organisms at the surveyed locations. In examining the efficacy and resolution of the applied ITS2 metabarcoding markers for bioassessments, we report large gaps in the variety of publicly available benthic ITS2 reference sequence data, limiting our ability to provide robust taxonomic assignments. These findings highlight the need to extend ITS2 databases for greater regional representation. Until this is adequately addressed, we recommend that investigating taxonomic assignments to a genus level is the most robust approach for benthic monitoring using eDNA. Lastly, we found eDNA metabarcoding and conventional belt transect surveys each detected numerous unique hard coral genera, indicating that a combined approach provides the most effective way to audit benthic biodiversity. This point notwithstanding, eDNA metabarcoding had the power to distinguish similar diversity trends between sites to that determined by the belt transect methodology, validating the application of eDNA metabarcoding as either a stand-alone, or complementary technique for assessing sessile benthic taxa.","2022-01-01","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26 19:16:54","2024-07-26","34-49","","1","4","","Environmental DNA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","benthic biodiversity; biomonitoring; marine invertebrates; marine park; Scleractinia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
